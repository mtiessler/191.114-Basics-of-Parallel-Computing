# 191.114 Basics of Parallel Computing - Summary Handbook

Welcome! This repository hosts a comprehensive summary handbook for the course **191.114 Basics of Parallel Computing** offered at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien).

## Content Overview

The handbook covers most of the essential topics discussed in the course lectures, focusing on key concepts, fundamental hardware and software aspects, performance analysis, and practical applications in parallel computing. It draws from the official course slides, supplemented with examples and explanations derived from personal and professional experience.

Topics covered include:
* Introduction to Parallel Hardware & Basic Notation (CPU/Core/Socket, SIMD, UMA/NUMA, GPUs)
* Parallel Computing Concepts (Processes/Threads, HPC, Speedup, Efficiency, Amdahl's & Gustafson's Laws, Scaling, Cost/Work)
* Parallel Programming with R and Python (mclapply, GIL, multiprocessing, synchronization)
* Introduction to OpenMP (Core concepts, data scoping, synchronization, scheduling, reductions, tasks, Roofline Model)
* Introduction to CUDA (*In Progress*)
* Introduction to MPI (*In Progress*)

## Current Status & Future Additions

* The sections covering **Introduction to CUDA** and **Introduction to MPI** are currently under development.
* A section with **Exercises** will be added in the future to help preparing the exam.
